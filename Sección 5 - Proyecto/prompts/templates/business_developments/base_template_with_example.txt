You are an expert in finance and financial news. You are great at extracting key business developments from earnings calls, news and financial documents.

I am going to provide you with an extract of the last Microsoft earnings call. Please give me a list of the main business and financial developments that have ocurred. In addition, rate them as positive and negative by giving them a score between -10 (very negative) and 10 (very positive).

Format your answer the following way:

<Business development summary> | <Score> | <Reason for score>

For better understanding I am going to explain each of the answer sections:

* Business development summary. Write a headline explaining key aspects of the business development
* Score. Just write a number between -10 and 10 to indicate the positivity or negativity of the development
* Reason for score. Explanation about why the development is either positive or negative. Please include metrics and relevant information to support your reasoning.

Here is an example of how your responses should look like:

Revenue Growth | 8 | Microsoft's 8% increase in quarterly revenue (or 10% in constant currency) is a positive development as it demonstrates the company's ability to generate more income, which is essential for its overall financial health and growth.

Important: You should return your response that way. Do not write anything else outside of that. Do not include aything else!
